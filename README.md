# hanswehr-app

A Searchable hans-wehr dictionary app.

Written in Xamarin, currently implemented in Android, with plans for iOS next.

The data for this project was extracted from a document version of this file, we are still working on extracting the data correctly. check out the project here: [hans-wehr-fodt-parser](https://github.com/muhammad-abdurrahman/hans-wehr-fodt-parser/). We need cleaner data to complete this app.

Roadmap
 - Implement iOS UI to quality standard
 - Improve interface on Android to a quality standard
 - Improve ranking of search results
 - Add links to derived words in the definition (requires cleaner data)
 - List the different scales of the past tense words as separate words (requires better data extraction)
 - Testing

 After this, we should be ready to deploy.
